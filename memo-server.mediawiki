# Purpose

Currently, you can export your BIP-39 mnemonic from one wallet, and import
that mnemonic into another wallet supporting the same scheme, and all th funs will
show up. What does not show up are the extra things like memos and notes
the user has attached to certain transactions that wallet has made.

This doucment describes a system for saving transaction memos so they can be shared
between wallets. This system's working name is "memo server".

# API

The memo server reference implementation will be written in Python, and will run over the HTTPS protocol.
Memos servers do not store financial data,
do store personal data. For this reason, the memo server does not need to
be ran anonymously, but encrypted communication is still needed.

Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network has to be anonymous to avoid money transmitter laws.
Memo server, on the other hand, only needs to store it's contents encrypted, and
be able to run by anyone who chooses to run a server.

# Endpoints

There will be three endpoints:

## example-memo-server.com/api/publish_memo?memo&signature&side&index&crypto&txid

After the users enters a memo to the wallet software, the wallet software encodes the
memo, calculates a signature, and then sends that data off to the memo server
that wallet has been programmed to use.

See the section below to learn how the wallet should prepare the `memo` and `signature` fields.

The memo server will accept as many memos for a single transaction as there are inputs and outputs.
This means if a transaction has 5 inputs and 3 outputs, the memo server will store as many as 8
memos for this transaction. The reasoning behind this is that memos are specific to a user.
The `side` and `index` arguments are for specifying which input or output this memo belongs to.
Side can be wither "input" or "output", and a value of 0 for `index` means the first one.

This API call is made ever time the user makes a transaction or when they want to change the
contents of a memo.

The `crypto` argument specifies which currency the memoserver should store this memo to.
It should be a three or four letter, case insensitive string.

Publishing a new memo overwrites all existing memos with the same `index` and `side`, assuming the
signature is valid.

## example-memo-server.com/api/get_memos?txid&crypto

This endpoint is used at wallet import time. After the wallet determines which transactions
make up a user's wallet, a series of API calls are to be made through this endpoint.

Notice that there is no `side` and `index` arguments. The memo server must return *all*
memos attached to the txid and crypto. This is for privacy reasons: the wallet does not reveal to the memo
server which address it controls.

## example-memo-server.com/api/memo_sync?last_sync

This endpoint is only called by *other* memo servers. When setting up a memo server, you can specify
a set of other memo servers that you get memos from. On a regular schedule, your
memo server will call all the other memo servers throught his endpoint to get all
newly published memos since the last time
